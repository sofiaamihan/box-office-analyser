# Box Office Analyser
Developed and trained based on a [Comprehensive Film Statistics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrolobello/the-ultimate-film-statistics-dataset-for-ml/data), this **Worldwide Gross Revenue ($) Predictive Model 
for Movies** served as my final submission for CAI2C08 Machine Learning. With an approximately **67% Adjusted-RÂ² Value**, my extensive analysis and training catered quite well towards the complexity, depth, and imbalance of this 
dataset. Hosted via Streamlit, my application of this model can be accessed [here](https://sofiaamihan-box-office-analyser-application-rge5mk.streamlit.app/).

Inclusive of my well-researched [Report Analysis]() of the dataset, I gained valuable insights into the film industry by approaching it from a more analytical and data-driven perspective through the recognition of inherent 
challenges and unpredictability of box office performances.
